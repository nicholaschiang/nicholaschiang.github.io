	<h1>Education</h1>
	<p>I'm currently attending Gunn High School as a freshman, I hold a brown belt in <a href="http://www.svkarate.com">Shotokan Karate</a>, and am currently a BSA Life Scout.</p>
	<h3>Gunn High School</h3>
	<p>I'm currently attending Gunn High School as a freshman and am working on assignments for Bio H, Geo H, <a href="http://paleyontology.com/foop/">FOOP</a> (Functional Object-Oriented Programming, the pre-req for AP CS), and Japanese 2.</p>
	<h3>Karate</h3>
	<p>I've been training for almost 4 years now under Sensei Jon Keeling with <a href="http://www.svkarate.com">Shotokan Karate</a> and currently hold a first-degree brown belt.(</p>
	<h3>Boy Scouts of America</h3>
	<p>I started my BSA experience many years ago under the cub scouts organization and I've been working towards Eagle ever since (for about 7 years now). I'm currently a Life Scout (one rank from Eagle) and will be planning an Eagle Scout Project soon.</p>
	<h3>Computer Science</h3>
	<p>Tech has always been a major interest of mine and I can never get enough of it. Discovering how it all works, building a website like those I've always frequented, and exploring the world of computer science both at home, at Gunn (in AP CS), and by helping out at Stanford (working with <a href="http://lukehsiao.github.io">Luke Hsiao</a> on an <a href="http://conf.researchr.org/home/LCTES-2018">LCTES</a> Submission).</p>
