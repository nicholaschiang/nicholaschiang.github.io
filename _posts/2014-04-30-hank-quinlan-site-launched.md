Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

Just FYI, I don't actually write or talk like this in real life. I was just following a tutorial and thought it would be funny to leave the default blog post intact... (and I assure you, my sense of humor is also a lot better in person)
