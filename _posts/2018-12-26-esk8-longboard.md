This could definitely turn out to be a very long thread, so I'll try to keep the backstory intro short.

For Christmas this year (and I guess also for my birthday... as they're both on 12/25), I was gifted a Magneto 44 Inch Kicktail Cruiser Longboard after expressing some interest in an electric skateboard (thinking it would be cool to try out a boosted board as a way to switch up the commute to school) on my Christmas list. And while this definitely was a nice gift, after taking it around the block for a spin, I immediately started researching the cheapest way to upgrade it to an electric-motor-powered vehicle in a sustainable fashion (i.e. relatively durable components).

So I decided that I would compile all of the useful links and info regarding such an endeavor here so as to:
1. Make it easy for me to find previously discovered wikis or other useful articles
2. Provide a much more streamlined research experience for any other maker also interested in doing such an upgrade
