This could definitely turn out to be a very long thread, so I'll try to keep the backstory intro short.

For Christmas this year (and I guess also for my birthday... as they're both on 12/25), I was gifted a *Magneto 44 Inch Kicktail Cruiser Longboard* after expressing some interest in an electric skateboard (thinking it would be cool to try out a *Boosted Board* as a way to switch up the commute to school) on my Christmas list. And while this was definitely a nice gift, after taking it around the block, I immediately started researching the cheapest way to upgrade it to an electric-motor-powered vehicle in a sustainable fashion (i.e. relatively durable components).

So I decided that I would compile all of the useful links and info regarding such an endeavor here so as to:
> 1. Make it easy for me to find previously discovered wikis or other useful articles
> 2. Provide a much more streamlined research experience for any other maker also interested in doing such an upgrade

Here goes nothing... (Oh, and if you haven't already, make sure to check out the official [ESK8 Wiki](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders))
