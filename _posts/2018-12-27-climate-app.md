I know that it's only been a day since I first posted about my ESK8 endeavor, but (as it is winter break, and I don't have much else to do) I decided that I might as well post about this as well. While this will probably get taken down as soon as I actually finish the project, I'm going to continue to update this as I progress in order to document the build process and make it easier to realize other app ideas.

My main driver for this project is just so that I can say that I tried, that I actually did *something* to try to solve our over-arching problem: **global warming**. Another one of the original motivations was to actually write something applicable for my English letter-to-authority (about something that needs to change, etc.) project... so, of course, I decided to write to Elon Musk regarding a global warming solution: a mobile carbon emissions tracker, something that could be easily distributed to millions with little (haha, basically none for me) entry cost, an app that would encourage people to change individual by individual.

So I'm here to try to document how I went about learning about Andriod and iOS app development (as I've never done this before) and how I ultimately either finish such an app or why I might give up in the future.

Stay tuned...

## The Dream
I wanted to create an app that, with the little initial setup of selecting your main vehicle of commute (i.e. car make and model), one could tell exactly how big their carbon footprint is and how to best reduce that carbon footprint to a more sustainable model. (I would calculate their daily *carbon quota* based off that car and give them a goal to reach in order to make living on Earth sustainable... i.e. the point where we start reducing carbon instead of adding)

## Progress (mostly problems)
The first big problem that I encountered was the issue of actually putting together a reliable database with an adequate selection of cars and their correlating carbon emissions.

That's the problem that I'm working on right now... and I haven't made much progress as of now.
