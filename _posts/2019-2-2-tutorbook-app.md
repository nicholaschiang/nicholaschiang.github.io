I don't have as much time to write this post (but, as pretty much no one is going to actually read it, it doesn't matter how bad it is...) as I have had in previous posts, so, while I'm going to be very concise, I will still try to maintain the same aesthetic as previous posts. (And please forgive any typos or terrible wording, this is going to be fast)

### [GitHub Repository]("https://github.com/nicholaschiang/tutorbook" "GitHub Repository")

My main driver for this project was to one, finish something interesting for my Eagle Scout Project, and two, actually make something that might help people in real life.

While this blog post is supposed to be informative to anyone who happens to come across it (or who is looking to learn how to make such an app themselves), it will most likely be used more by me as a location where I can jot down ideas, timelines, and other useful information regarding the app.

Stay tuned...

## The Dream
I wanted to create an app that, with the little initial setup of selecting your needed tutoring services, one would be able to easily and quickly select a qualified tutor and start the process of scheduling meetings without having to go through (in my case at Henry M. Gunn High School) the Main Office or the library's AC staff to make appointments.

## Progress
As of right now, this is going to be me mostly just jotting down possible app ideas and other problems that I've encountered during development.

So far, all I really have completed, as far as my Andriod app interface goes, is a simple bottom navigation bar (that maps to different `Fragments` that display useful info to the user) and a Firebase back-end that allows users to quickly create and sign into secure accounts.
