A couple of days ago I added a <a href="https://biteable.com/watch/minimalism-psa-2066406">Minimalism PSA</a> to my homepage, (so as to give my English teacher, Ms. Ja, an easy way to access it) but as that assignment has now been graded (I got full score for anyone curious) I've taken that embed down and listed it here.

Thanks for watching!
